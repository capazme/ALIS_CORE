# A/B Simulation Configuration
# RLCF vs Baseline Comparison

simulation:
  name: "RLCF Authority Weighting A/B Test"
  version: "1.0"
  date: "2025-01-25"

parameters:
  # Number of synthetic users
  num_users: 100

  # Number of evaluation tasks
  num_tasks: 50

  # Simulation iterations
  num_iterations: 20

  # Pareto distribution alpha for authority scores
  # Lower alpha = more inequality (few experts, many novices)
  authority_alpha: 2.0

  # Base noise level for ratings
  # Higher authority users have proportionally less noise
  noise_level: 0.2

  # Rating scale range
