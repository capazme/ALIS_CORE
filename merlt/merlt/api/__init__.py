MERL-T API Module
=================

FastAPI routers per integrazioni esterne.

Routers:
- ingestion_api: Ingestion da fonti esterne (VisuaLex)
- feedback_api: Ricezione feedback RLCF
- auth_api: Sincronizzazione authority utente
- experts_router: Query multi-expert system
- enrichment_router: Live enrichment con validazione community
- document_router: Upload e parsing documenti utente
- amendments_router: Submission e gestione amendments (multivigenza)
- graph_router: API per visualizzazione Knowledge Graph
- pipeline_router: Monitoring pipeline ingestion/enrichment
- citation_router: Citation export in multiple formats

Esempio:
    >>> from fastapi import FastAPI
    >>> from merlt.api import (
    ...     ingestion_router,
    ...     feedback_router,
    ...     auth_router,
    ...     enrichment_router,
    ...     document_router,
    ...     amendments_router,
    ...     graph_router,
    ...     pipeline_router,
    ...     citation_router,
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> app = FastAPI(title="MERL-T API")
    >>> app.include_router(ingestion_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(feedback_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(auth_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(enrichment_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(document_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(amendments_router, prefix="/api/v1")
    >>> app.include_router(graph_router, prefix="/api/v1")
