Abstract: This study examines the theoretical and practical challenges organizations face when transforming proprietary knowledge assets into AI-accessible computational resources. We identify the "knowledge commoditization paradox": the simultaneous necessity and impossibility of reducing complex organizational knowledge to tradable computational representations (Allega & Puzio, 2025a). Drawing on information economics, organizational knowledge theory, and computational linguistics, we analyze how vectorization processes alter the epistemological status of organizational knowledge, converting contextually embedded expertise into decontextualized mathematical objects. Through conceptual analysis with implications for knowledge-intensive sectors such as legal services (Allega & Puzio, 2025b; Allega, 2025), healthcare, and financial analysis, we identify three categories of challenges—technical (semantic loss, interpretative validity), economic (pricing paradoxes, market formation), and socio-organizational (professional identity, competitive advantage). Our findings reveal recursive complexity where technical solutions generate economic problems, economic innovations create organizational tensions, and organizational adaptations reveal new technical requirements. This recursive pattern suggests that linear implementation strategies are fundamentally inadequate for addressing the systemic nature of knowledge commoditization. We demonstrate how organizations attempting to extract value from AI-mediated knowledge systems encounter diminishing returns as the granularization required for computational processing undermines the contextual coherence that constitutes knowledge value. The research contributes to AI implementation literature by highlighting the irreducibly complex nature of knowledge commoditization and suggesting integrated approaches that acknowledge systemic interdependencies. We conclude that successful implementation requires reconceptualizing knowledge not as a static asset but as a dynamic process of meaning creation that resists complete computational capture, necessitating hybrid architectures that balance computational efficiency with semantic preservation.

1. Introduction

The transformation of organizational knowledge into machine-readable formats represents one of the most significant challenges facing information-intensive organizations in the digital era. As artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge production, distribution, and consumption processes, organizations confront a fundamental paradox: the imperative to commoditize knowledge for computational processing simultaneously undermines the contextual richness that gives knowledge its organizational value (Arrow, 1962; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Zuboff, 2019). This paper examines the theoretical foundations and practical manifestations of this paradox, analyzing how the process of semantic vectorization—the conversion of textual knowledge into mathematical representations—creates recursive challenges across technical, economic, and organizational dimensions.

The urgency of understanding these challenges has intensified with the rapid deployment of large language models and semantic search technologies in professional contexts. Organizations increasingly rely on vector embeddings to enable semantic similarity search, automated knowledge retrieval, and AI-mediated decision support (Devlin et al., 2019; Vaswani et al., 2017). However, the transformation of nuanced professional knowledge into vector representations introduces what we identify as "semantic entropy"—the progressive loss of contextual information through successive layers of computational abstraction. This entropy manifests not merely as technical inefficiency but as a fundamental epistemological transformation that alters how organizations create, validate, and exchange knowledge.

Our analysis reveals that the commoditization of knowledge through AI systems challenges core assumptions about information economics established by Arrow (1962) and extended by Stiglitz (2000). While digital information exhibits near-zero marginal costs of reproduction, the creation of high-quality vector embeddings requires substantial domain expertise, computational resources, and iterative refinement. This creates a paradox where the economic efficiency promised by digital distribution conflicts with the investment required for semantic fidelity. Organizations must navigate between two undesirable extremes: oversimplified representations that fail to capture domain complexity, or elaborate encoding schemes that reintroduce the transaction costs that digitalization was meant to eliminate (Allega & Puzio, 2025a).

2. Literature Review

This literature review synthesizes three primary bodies of research that have evolved independently but now intersect in the context of computational knowledge management: the philosophical and organizational foundations of knowledge commoditization, the economic dimensions of information markets under conditions of extreme granularization, and the organizational implications of AI-mediated knowledge systems. Each domain contributes essential insights while revealing gaps that emerge at their intersection.

The existing literature, while extensive in each domain, has yet to fully address the emergent properties that arise when knowledge simultaneously exists as human expertise, organizational asset, and computational resource. Traditional frameworks developed for physical goods or even digital products prove inadequate when applied to knowledge that can be infinitely decomposed yet loses value through decomposition. This review traces the evolution of thinking in each domain while identifying the theoretical innovations required to understand knowledge commoditization as a unified phenomenon rather than a collection of separate technical, economic, and organizational challenges.

2.1. Theoretical Foundations of Knowledge Commoditization

The commoditization of knowledge has been a central concern in organizational theory since Polanyi's (1966) distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) extended this framework through their SECI model, proposing that knowledge creation occurs through conversion between tacit and explicit forms. However, the introduction of AI-mediated knowledge processing introduces a third category: computational knowledge, which exists as mathematical representations that are neither fully tacit nor traditionally explicit. This computational form challenges existing frameworks by introducing what Floridi (2011) terms "semantic information"—structured data endowed with meaning through algorithmic interpretation rather than human understanding.

Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled the transformation of textual knowledge into high-dimensional vector spaces where semantic similarity can be computed mathematically (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). These word embedding techniques, evolved through transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) and contextualized representations (Devlin et al., 2019), promise to capture semantic relationships that traditional keyword-based systems miss. However, Bender and Koller (2020) argue that these representations lack true understanding, operating instead through statistical correlations that may not preserve causal or logical relationships essential to professional knowledge.

2.2. Economic Dimensions of Information Markets

The economics of information markets has been extensively studied since Arrow's (1962) seminal work identifying the fundamental paradox of information goods: buyers cannot assess value without consuming the information, but once consumed, they have no incentive to pay. Shapiro and Varian (1999) extended this analysis to digital markets, emphasizing network effects and lock-in dynamics. However, the granularization of knowledge into vector embeddings introduces new complexities. Unlike traditional information goods sold as complete products, vectorized knowledge enables micropayment models where organizations charge for individual semantic queries (Brynjolfsson et al., 2019).

2.3. Organizational Implications and Resistance

The organizational implications of knowledge commoditization extend beyond technical implementation to fundamental questions of professional identity and power structures. Susskind and Susskind (2015) argue that AI-mediated knowledge systems challenge the "grand bargain" of professionalism, where expertise monopolies justified premium pricing. The decomposition of professional knowledge into queryable vectors threatens established hierarchies based on information asymmetry (Abbott, 1988). Knowledge workers resist commoditization not merely from economic self-interest but from concerns about the decontextualization of expertise and loss of interpretative authority (Pachidi et al., 2021; Allega & Puzio, 2025c).

3. Theoretical Framework and Analysis

We propose a multi-dimensional framework for understanding the knowledge commoditization paradox that integrates technical, economic, and organizational perspectives. At the technical level, we identify "semantic entropy" as the progressive degradation of contextual information through vectorization (Allega & Puzio, 2025a). This entropy manifests through three mechanisms: dimensional reduction (the compression of infinite semantic space into finite vectors), decontextualization (the stripping of situational cues), and homogenization (the standardization required for computational processing).

The economic dimension reveals pricing paradoxes unique to granular knowledge markets. Traditional information goods exhibit network effects where value increases with user adoption (Katz & Shapiro, 1985). However, vectorized knowledge exhibits "anti-network effects" where excessive queries may reveal the underlying knowledge structure, enabling reverse engineering that undermines value. Organizations must balance accessibility against protection, creating what we term "selective opacity"—strategically limiting query depth to prevent knowledge extraction while maintaining service utility.

Figure 1 illustrates the recursive nature of implementation challenges across these dimensions. Technical solutions (such as improved embedding algorithms) create economic problems (increased computational costs), which generate organizational tensions (resistance from professionals whose expertise is being commoditized), which in turn reveal new technical requirements (need for domain-specific fine-tuning). This recursive complexity suggests that linear implementation strategies are fundamentally inadequate.

4. Discussion

Our analysis reveals that the knowledge commoditization paradox cannot be resolved through technological advancement alone. The fundamental tension between semantic richness and computational accessibility reflects deeper epistemological limits on the formalization of human knowledge. While improvements in embedding techniques may reduce semantic loss, they cannot eliminate the interpretative gap between statistical correlation and causal understanding. Organizations pursuing knowledge commoditization must therefore adopt what we term "hybrid architectures" that preserve human interpretative authority while leveraging computational scalability (Allega & Puzio, 2025c).

The economic implications extend beyond pricing models to fundamental questions about value creation and capture. Traditional competitive advantage theory assumes that valuable knowledge can be protected through secrecy or legal mechanisms (Barney, 1991). However, the vectorization of knowledge creates a new form of vulnerability: "semantic leakage" through aggregated query patterns. Organizations must develop new frameworks for assessing and managing this risk, potentially drawing on differential privacy techniques from computer science (Dwork & Roth, 2014).

The organizational dimension reveals the need for new forms of professional identity that embrace rather than resist computational mediation. Rather than viewing AI as displacing human expertise, organizations should foster "computational professionalism"—the ability to curate, validate, and contextualize machine-generated insights. This requires not just technical training but fundamental shifts in how professionals conceptualize their value contribution. The most successful implementations will likely emerge from organizations that treat knowledge commoditization not as a technical project but as a socio-technical transformation requiring integrated change management across multiple dimensions (Allega, 2025).

5. Conclusions

This research has examined the fundamental challenges organizations face when attempting to commoditize knowledge through AI-mediated systems. Our analysis reveals that the knowledge commoditization paradox—the simultaneous necessity and impossibility of reducing complex organizational knowledge to tradable computational representations—cannot be resolved through technical solutions alone. The recursive complexity across technical, economic, and organizational dimensions requires integrated approaches that acknowledge systemic interdependencies.

The theoretical contribution of this work lies in identifying semantic entropy as a fundamental constraint on knowledge commoditization and demonstrating how technical solutions generate economic and organizational challenges that recursively create new technical requirements. This framework extends existing information economics and knowledge management theories to account for the unique characteristics of AI-mediated knowledge systems. The practical implications suggest that organizations should adopt hybrid architectures that balance computational efficiency with semantic fidelity (Allega & Puzio, 2025b), develop new economic models that account for semantic leakage risks, and foster computational professionalism among knowledge workers.

Future research should explore alternative frameworks for valuing and exchanging computational knowledge that preserve semantic richness while enabling economic sustainability. Promising directions include commons-based models that treat knowledge as a shared resource, cooperative structures that align incentives across stakeholders, and hybrid architectures that dynamically balance commoditization with knowledge stewardship. As AI continues to transform how organizations create, capture, and distribute value, understanding the limits and possibilities of knowledge commoditization becomes essential for both theoretical advancement and practical implementation (Allega, 2025).
